## Working With Pages

See the
[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages)
for working with wiki pages.

There is no rule when it comes to CamelCase page names or dash-case page names.
Use whichever you prefer. Textadept's previous wiki stored all pages internally
as dash-case, but allowed CamelCase links.

## Working with Files

You can upload files to the wiki and link to them from a page. When doing so,
please create a separate page that will link to those files. Do not link to
files from the home page, for example.

In order to upload files to the wiki and link to them, you will need to:

1. [Clone the wiki on your computer](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages#adding-or-editing-wiki-pages-locally).
2. Create a folder for your files and add them. *Please use a folder with the
   same name as the page you intend to link to them from.*
3. Commit the files.

You can then link to those files using a *folder/filename.ext* relative path.

The wiki repository has examples of the proper use of pages, files, and links.
