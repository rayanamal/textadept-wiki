## Introduction

Yang is a simple structured language for defining networking components. It was
specified back in 2010 by the IETF. The full specification is available
[here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6020/).

## Initial support for YANG in Textadept

I have written a module that provides initial support for editing YANG files
with TextAdept. It is available at my
[github](https://github.com/paaguti/ta-yang) with installation instructions.
Fork it, enhance it and send me pull requests to integrate your improvements.
